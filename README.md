# Sub-Series Search

## What it does?
An algorithm that given a series of numerical values, S =< S1, S2,...,Sk >, of length k and a reference series of numerical values, T, of length m, where m > k, finds the sub-series of T that is the closest match to S.

## So does it work?
Yes, provide a list of numerical values as well as another list to query the first and it will find you the closest match.

## Why was it made?
Produced for my Data Structures and Algorithm class.
